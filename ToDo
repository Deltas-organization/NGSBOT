Allow the bot to listen to a command and post the schedule in the channel without me having to hard code the list.

Get the bot to check his permissions so he can tell people he doesn't have permissions to do things.
Stop the bot from removing div roles once a team has withdrawn so they can still party in the div chat for the season.
